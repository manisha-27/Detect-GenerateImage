# Face Detection and Black & White Conversion

This project demonstrates how to use Python and OpenCV to detect faces in an image and convert the detected face to a black and white (grayscale) image. This can be useful for various applications, such as face recognition and image preprocessing.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)
- An input image containing a face

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

2. Place your input image (the image containing the face you want to detect) in the same directory as the Python script.

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The script will detect the face in the input image, convert it to black and white, and save the black and white face image as `abc2.jpg` in the same directory.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the script by modifying the following parameters:

- Input image path: Replace `'abc.jpg'` with the path to your input image in the Python script.

- Haar Cascade classifier: You can use a different Haar Cascade classifier for face detection, depending on your specific use case. Make sure to update the classifier path in the script if needed.

## Example

Here's an example of an input image and the corresponding black and white face image generated by the script:

| Input Image                            | Black & White Face Image               |
